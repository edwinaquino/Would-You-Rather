/* display 404 error page when question is not found */
// REquirement: The application asks the user to sign in and shows a 404 page if that poll does not exist. (In other words, if a user creates a poll and then the same or another user tries to access that poll by its url, the user should be asked to sign in and then be shown a 404 page. Please keep in mind that new polls will not be accessible at their url because of the way the backend is set up in this application.)
